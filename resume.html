                        &emsp;&emsp;Hi, I'm Ray Chang. I'm passionate about software development as it allows me to be involved in the entire process, from concept to implementation, and to see the end product come to fruition.

                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;My name is Ray, and I am excited to apply for AppWorks School Batch #22.<br>
                    I majored in Physics and graduated from Fu-Jen University. Although I am new to coding, I have a strong passion for programming. During my university years, I led several development teams and successfully completed various team projects. I believe my leadership skills and willingness to go the extra mile make me a great candidate for Batch #22.<br>
                    <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;My background in physics has trained me to have a good logical ability and a strong foundation in science, which I believe will be beneficial in the field of programming. Additionally, I am a self-learner and achieved the TOEIC Golden Certificate, demonstrating my proficiency in English.<br>
                    <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Even though computer science is not my major, I have taken several relevant courses, such as "Introduction to Intelligent Robot and Application," "Interactive Control Programming," "Introduction to Computer Science," and "Python."

Through these activities, I realized the importance of teamwork and the benefits of seeking the best solutions together in a brainstorming atmosphere.<br>
                    <br>
